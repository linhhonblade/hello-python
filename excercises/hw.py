# 1. =============================================
# Write a program (function!) that takes a list
# and returns a new list that contains all the elements
# of the first list minus all the duplicates.

# 2. =============================================
# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them.

# 3. =============================================
# Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not.
# (For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has no divisors.)

# 4. =============================================
# a = {1: 'misa', 11: 'hello', 3: 23}
# Find the way to:
# show all the keys in a
# return value of key 11
# clear the entire dictionary a
# get the length of a
# get the type of a
# identify the key with the highest value (among other keys)
# identify the key with the lowest value (among other keys)

# 5. ==============================================
# b = list(range(10))
# Guest the result of the following statement and check them yourself by python
# print(b[1:3])
# print(b[2:6])
# print(b[2:6:2])
# print(b[0:8:3])
# print(b[::2])
# print(b[::])
# print(b[:5:2])
# print(b[3::2])
# print(b[:-2])
# print(b[2:-2])
# print(b[::-1])
# print(b[:-2:-2])

# 6. ==============================================
# c = [1, 12, 43, 44, 64, 45, 90, 6, 27, 231, 432, 88]
# Use sorted() to sort c in ascendant order
# Use filter() to filter only values greater than 50 from c
# Use map() to double every item in c
# Use reduce() to calculate sum of all items in c (from functools module)

# 7. ==============================================
# Implement one of these sorting algorithms: bubble sort, quick sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort
