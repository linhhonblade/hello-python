# 6. =============================================
# Write a program (function!) that takes a list
# and returns a new list that contains all the elements
# of the first list minus all the duplicates.

# 7. ==============================================
# c = [1, 12, 43, 44, 64, 45, 90, 6, 27, 231, 432, 88]
# Use sorted() to sort c in ascendant order
# Use filter() to filter only values greater than 50 from c
# Use map() to double every item in c
# Use reduce() to calculate sum of all items in c (from functools module)

# 8. ==============================================
# Implement one of these sorting algorithms: bubble sort, quick sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort

# 9. ==============================================
# Define a class which has at least two methods:
# getString: to get a string from console input
# printString: to print the string in upper case.
# Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.

# 10. ==============================================
# Define a class named Rectangle which can be constructed by a length and width. 
# The Rectangle class has a method which can compute the area. 

# 11. ==============================================
# You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order 
# where name is string, age and height are numbers. 
# The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:
# 1: Sort based on name;
# 2: Then sort based on age;
# 3: Then sort by score.
# The priority is that name > age > score.
# If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
# Tom,19,80
# John,20,90
# Jony,17,91
# Jony,17,93
# Json,21,85
# Then, the output of the program should be:
# [('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]
