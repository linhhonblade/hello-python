# 1. =============================================
# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them.

# 2. =============================================
# Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not.
# (For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has no divisors.)

# 3. =============================================
# a = {1: 'misa', 11: 'hello', 3: 23}
# Find the way to:
# show all the keys in a
# return value of key 11
# clear the entire dictionary a
# get the length of a
# get the type of a
# identify the key with the highest value (among other keys)
# identify the key with the lowest value (among other keys)

# 4. ==============================================
# b = list(range(10))
# Guest the result of the following statement and check them yourself by python
# print(b[1:3])
# print(b[2:6])
# print(b[2:6:2])
# print(b[0:8:3])
# print(b[::2])
# print(b[::])
# print(b[:5:2])
# print(b[3::2])
# print(b[:-2])
# print(b[2:-2])
# print(b[::-1])
# print(b[:-2:-2])

# 5. ==============================================
# Couting sheep program
# Create a program to count sheep
# Start with zero sheep
# if user input 'n', add one sheep
# if user input 'p', minus one sheep
# if user input 'c', print the number of sheeps counted
# if number of sheep is 0 and user input 'q', send a message 'No sheep left'
# if user enter 'q', print the number of sheeps counted and end the program
# if user enter any other character: do nothing
