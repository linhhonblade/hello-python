# 1. =============================================
# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them.

# 2. =============================================
# Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not.
# (For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has no divisors.)

# 3. =============================================
# a = {1: 'misa', 11: 'hello', 3: 23}
# Find the way to:
# show all the keys in a
# return value of key 11
# clear the entire dictionary a
# get the length of a
# get the type of a
# identify the key with the highest value (among other keys)
# identify the key with the lowest value (among other keys)

# 4. ==============================================
# b = list(range(10))
# Guest the result of the following statement and check them yourself by python
# print(b[1:3])
# print(b[2:6])
# print(b[2:6:2])
# print(b[0:8:3])
# print(b[::2])
# print(b[::])
# print(b[:5:2])
# print(b[3::2])
# print(b[:-2])
# print(b[2:-2])
# print(b[::-1])
# print(b[:-2:-2])

# 5. ==============================================
# Couting sheep program
# Create a program to count sheep
# Start with zero sheep
# if user input 'n', add one sheep
# if user input 'p', minus one sheep
# if user input 'c', print the number of sheeps counted
# if number of sheep is 0 and user input 'q', send a message 'No sheep left'
# if user enter 'q', print the number of sheeps counted and end the program
# if user enter any other character: do nothing









# 1. =============================================
# Write a program (function!) that takes a list
# and returns a new list that contains all the elements
# of the first list minus all the duplicates.





# 6. ==============================================
# c = [1, 12, 43, 44, 64, 45, 90, 6, 27, 231, 432, 88]
# Use sorted() to sort c in ascendant order
# Use filter() to filter only values greater than 50 from c
# Use map() to double every item in c
# Use reduce() to calculate sum of all items in c (from functools module)

# 7. ==============================================
# Implement one of these sorting algorithms: bubble sort, quick sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort

# 8. ==============================================
# Define a class which has at least two methods:
# getString: to get a string from console input
# printString: to print the string in upper case.
# Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.

# 9. ==============================================
# You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order 
# where name is string, age and height are numbers. 
# The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:
# 1: Sort based on name;
# 2: Then sort based on age;
# 3: Then sort by score.
# The priority is that name > age > score.
# If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
# Tom,19,80
# John,20,90
# Jony,17,91
# Jony,17,93
# Json,21,85
# Then, the output of the program should be:
# [('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]

# 10. ==============================================
# Define a class named Rectangle which can be constructed by a length and width. 
# The Rectangle class has a method which can compute the area.
